## Mini History of Version Control

Version control is about recording different versions of a file or a set of files, so you can access them whenever you want to.

Naive version controlling is copy-pasting files into different directories. This is error-prone as we can forget which folder we copy pased into.

Then, comes VCSs (Version Control Systems) which consisted of a database holding the sets of changes made to a set of files.

CVCSs (Centralized Version Control Systems) came as an upgrade over VCSs by offering a single server that multiple developers can use to access versioned files.
