# What's this about?

Like a lot of people, I'm well-versed with Git's basic commands. I'm talking about stuff like `git pull`, `git commit` and `git push`, along with a faint understanding of working and staging indexes.

After completing a recent project, I found myself Googling more advanced Git commands, and feeling like I was missing a lot of context. I didn't feel comfortable rolling back a commit, especially one that I've pushed up remote. It was also frustrating to copy and paste lines from Stack Overflow and hope they'd fix the problem I accidentally caused!

So, this is an attempt at gaining a better understanding of Git!
